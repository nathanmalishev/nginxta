## nginx teach-accounting

This repo contains the nginx server that powers the redirects to our dev & production API.  
Since we are running nginx, imbetween the servers some CORS work had to be added.  
At the moment we are allowing cross-origin-requests from everywhere - so we are exposed.  
Best to fix this before the end of the semester! ðŸ˜¿
